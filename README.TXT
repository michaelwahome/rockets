# Rockets 

This is a Java based game made using Greenfoot, the 2-dimensional game engine. In this game, one plays as a rocket, whose aim is to shoot down the meteors raining down on it.

## HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:

1. To play this game, one should have Greenfoot installed (as well as a suitable JDK).
2. At the top left of the Greenfoot window, on the menu bar, click Scenario. From the context menu that opens, choose the Open option. Alternatively, use the shortcut Ctrl + O.
3. Navigate to the project directory where the game is located.
4. When the game has loaded, click on Run.

## HOW TO PLAY:

The aim of the game is to shoot down all the meteors raining down on the rocket before they reach the bottom.
1. The left and right arrow keys move the rocket to the right and left.
2. The space bar shoots a missile.
3. Try to hit all the meteors with missile before they reach the bottom of the screen.
4. The player has 3 lives, with 1 life being deducted every time a meteor manages to reach the bottom of the screen.
5. If 21 meteors are successfully shot down before the player's lives end, then the player wins the game.
6. Press Reset to play again.
